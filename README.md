Excel spreadsheets to assist with data transformation, conversion and geodetic computations

*** Coordinate Transformations ***
Transformation_Conversion.xlsx: 7-parameter similarity transformation and coordinate conversion between Cartesian and Geographic coordinate systems.

*** Coordinate Conversions ***
Krueger n-series.xlsx: Geographic to Grid and Grid to Geographic (recommended for working outside beyond a single MGA / UTM zone).
Krueger lambda series.xlsx: also known as Redfearn's equations. Accurate within a single MGA / UTM zone.
Transformation_Conversion.xlsx: 7-parameter similarity transformation and coordinate conversion between Cartesian and Geographic coordinate systems.

*** Ellipsoid Computations ***
Vincentys.xlsx: Direct and Indirect methods to calculate accurate geodetic positions, azimuths and distances on the ellipsoid.
